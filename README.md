# Copilot Hack Session

## Welcome to the world of GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

> [!Important]
> - Please use the Q&A section for asking your queries in the breakout section.
> - All attendees will be muted by default. Please raise your hand âœ‹ if you would like to discuss any topic and organizer of your room will unmute you.
> - Do not worry if you are not getting same response from GitHub Copilot as other members in the breakout room. We just have to reiterate the prompt based on the 4 pillars of the Prompt crafting, to get better results.
> - Complete the exercises in the sequential order.
> - We will be using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE for this Hack session. Please also add GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat Extensions to your Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE.

This repo contains sample code exercises, which can be tested using GitHub Copilot.

## Introduction Section

### Exercise 1
1. Generate documentation for the ***exercise1.jsx*** without using GitHub Copilot chat

> [!Tip]
> For this exercise, try to use GitHub Copilot code completion option.

### Exercise 2
1. Select ***exercise2.ts*** and use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand the logic of the program. Generate the documentation and a README markdown file for the program.
2. Create a new feature where you can add a new power-up sprite to the game, which the caterpillar can collect to become invincible for 5 seconds.
   
### Exercise 3

1. Create a new Java workspace, which will call an API from US National Weather Service to get the current temperature for a specific zipcode or city. The code should evaluate the temperature and identify the corresponding climate for that region.


> [!NOTE]  
> You are doing great! ðŸ¥³
> Now lets try some more exercises, to revise the concepts you have learnt about GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

## Revision Section

> [!NOTE]  
> - The goal is to make sure that you are familiar with concepts of GitHub Copilot
> - Your focus should be to explore how GitHub Copilot can help you to tackle even unknown codebase ðŸ™‚

### Exercise 1
1. Understand the COBOL file in ***exercise3.cbl*** and identify the underlying logic of the program.
2. Translate the codebase in exercise2.cbl to Typescript using GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Generate unit test cases for the newly created code 
4. Generate the documentation for the new code (including README markdown file).

### Exercise 2

1. Understand the existing logic in ***exercise5.cs*** and verify whether there are any existing issues/vulnerabilities. 
2. Add an additional feature to the existing solution using GitHub Copilot prompt crafting techniques.
3. Create unit test cases for the updated code and generate the documentation to the program in such a way that a person who is comparatively new to C# should be able to understand the logic.

### Exercise 3

1. Double check with Thermofisher Team wherther we need a bonus Exercise
