# Copilot Hack Session

## Welcome to the world of GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

> [!Important]
> - Please use the Q&A section for asking your queries in the breakout section.
> - All attendees will be muted by default. Please raise your hand âœ‹ if you would like to discuss any topic and organizer of your room will unmute you.
> - Do not worry if you are not getting same response from GitHub Copilot as other members in the breakout room. We just have to reiterate the prompt based on the 4 pillars of the Prompt crafting, to get better results.
> - Complete the exercises in the sequential order.
> - We will be using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE for this Hack session. Please also add GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat Extensions to your Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE.

This repo contains sample code exercises, which can be tested using GitHub Copilot.

## Introduction Section

### Exercise 1
1. Generate documentation for the ***exercise1.jsx*** without using GitHub Copilot chat

> [!Tip]
> For this exercise, try to use GitHub Copilot code completion option.

### Exercise 2
1. Select ***exercise2.ts*** and use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand the logic of the program. Generate the documentation and a README markdown file for the program.
2. Create a new feature where you can add a new power-up sprite to the game, which the caterpillar can collect to become invincible for 5 seconds.
   
### Exercise 3
1. Understand the COBOL file in ***exercise3.cbl*** and identify the underlying logic of the program.
2. Translate the codebase in exercise2.cbl to Python or Typescript using GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Generate unit test cases for the newly created code 
4. Generate the documentation for the new code (including README markdown file).
   

> [!NOTE]  
> You are doing great! ðŸ¥³
> Now lets try some more exercises, to revise the concepts you have learnt about GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

## Revision Section

> [!NOTE]  
> - The goal is to make sure that you are familiar with concepts of GitHub Copilot
> - Your focus should be to explore how GitHub Copilot can help you to tackle even unknown codebase ðŸ™‚

### Exercise 1
1. Create a new Java workspace, which will call an API from US National Weather Service to get the current temperature for a specific zipcode or city. The code should evaluate the temperature and identify the corresponding climate for that region.
2. Generate two unit test case scenarios for the newly created workspace.

### Exercise 2

1. Identify the issue in ***exercise4.py*** and fix it using GitHub Copilot chat.
2. Verify whether there are opportunities to refactor and optimize the existing code base.
3. Generate unit test cases for the newly created code 
4. Generate the documentation for the new code (including README markdown file).

## Bonus Section

> [!NOTE]
> - This section has been created if you have already completed all the above exercises and is interested to try any additional scenarios.
> - You can either complete this bonus section within the stipulated time of breakout session or can try it later as a practice exercise for GitHub Copilot

### Exercise 1

1. You are the software developer assigned to create a Java application to store student profile pictures for University. The student profile pictures should be stored in Azure Blob Storage and you have to link these profile pictures in Azure Blob to the corresponding row in Student table available in MSSQL Server database.
2. Add a feature to check whether the profile picture provided is having a minimum pixel size of 600x600 pixels
3. Add some additional features to handle some of the privacy requirements related to California Consumer Privacy Act
4. Add a feature to securely store and encrypt student profile pictures using some of the Azure services
5. Add a feature to retrieve and decrypt a student's profile picture using this application

## You are now a champion of GitHub Copilot ðŸ¥³
